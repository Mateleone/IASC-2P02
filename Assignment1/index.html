            <h2>1. Flatness</h2>
            <p><span class="clickable" id ="part-one">From inside the cave...</span></p>
            
            <p>In the cave we call home, we are shown the grand demonstration of how the sun and earth operate. A large circle, which we were told is the great and powerful Sun, remains steady at the center, while a smaller circle moves in and out of it. This, our teachers say, is the Earth rotating around the Sun. It is our understanding that what it means is that Earth shrinks and grows, vanishing into the Sun before reemerging anew. We believe that the Earth is pulsating, expanding and contracting as it carries out its celestial duty. When the smaller shadow moves toward the edge of the Sun and disappears for a moment we whisper to each other in hushed tones. We come to wonder what the earth does while in the sun. Has it ceased to existence? Will this be the instance it wont return? And then the smaller shadow grows again from within the larger, as though it has been reborn. Some say the sun is consuming the earth and spiting it back out. Others argue that it is the earth is reabsorbed into the sun before a new one is created. It would realy help if we were told what the earth and sun were.</p>

            <p>The concept of Flatness describes a way of understanding the world that is limited by perspective. To live in flatness is to see only in one dimension, to perceive only what is directly in front of us without the comprehension of anything but. To me, Flatness is the condition of being unable to think beyond what one has been conditioned to see. It is the inability to question, challenge, or expand your perception beyond. In the case of the people in the cave, their world is entirely dictated by flat projections on the wall. They have no concept of depth or rotation, no understanding that the Sun and Earth are not just shadows but spheres moving through a three demandional plane. Their worldview is Flat because they believe the shadows are the true forms of reality when they are only representations of something far more complex. What they perceive as the Earth expanding and contracting is the orbit of the Earth around the Sun, a movement they could never unerstand without breaking free from the wallâ€™s illusion. Their reality is constrained by the shadows before them, and until they step beyond the cave, they will never see the full picture of the universe that exists beyond their sight.

            </p>
            <h2>2. Seeing Double</h2>
            <p><span class="clickable" id ="part-two">From outside the cave...</span></p>

            <p>Outside the cave, the real demonstration of the sun and earth is a sphere representing the sun and a rotating sphere symbolizing the Earth. As earth rotates around the sun, the shadow changes shape and position, vanishing as it goes behind the sun, altering how the people inside the cave perceive the world. The people outside the cave now recognize the three dimensional nature of the world beyond the cave, now witnessing the true way the sun and earth operate. <span class= "clickable" id="third-change">Third change goes here</span>. <span class= "clickable"id="fourth-change">Fourth change goes here</span></p>

            <p>The concept of Seeing Double is the ability to recognize multiple perspectives simultaneously. It suggests that understanding the world requires seeing beyond a single, fixed perspective and acknowledging the existence of multiple realities shaped by context and perception. In this scenario, the people inside the cave and those outside experience two very different realities. The cave dwellers see shifting shadows and interpet them in unique ways which become their truth, unaware of the objects true reflection on reality. Meanwhile, those outside the cave understand that the shadows are merely a demonstration of a more complex reality. As the earth rotates around the sun, its position changes, making the shadow of the sphere go into and out of the shadow of the sun. Those inside assume the earth is being eaten or absorbed, while those outside understand how the earth is able to spin around the sun, being a distance from it that would be hard to comprehend inside the cave.. These two realities exist </p>
